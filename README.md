# CppProgram Airgead Banking Project

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I was tasked to create an application that allows bank users to see how their investments will grow over time. It needed to display Initial Investment Amount, Monthly Deposit, Annual Compounded Interest, and the Number of Years the Investment would last. After user input, the data would be shown in columns; year, the year end balance, and the year end earned interest. This information would be duplicated and shown under two different categories; "Balance and Interest Without Additional Monthly Deposits", and the same prompt, but with additional deposits. This would allow the user to forecast what changes could be made to meet their financial needs. 
  
# What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did particularly well was being persistent. This task was not easy, especially after learning C++ for only 5 weeks with no prior knowledge. I definitely struggled a lot during this project and wanted to just sleep it off, but I know that's not how the real world works for people that literally wait years and years for jobs like this. For my confidence level, I feel like I did spectacular.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Personally, if I had more time, I would've made the UI more elegant and friendly. It wouldn't necessarily have an effect on efficiency or security, however, it would be an application that more customers would enjoy using. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Most definitely the data calculations. Math really hasn't been my strong suit since high school, and even then it wasn't great. At first, I thought I had the compound interest calculations accurate, but I just kept on getting the wrong output from my test data. Tried to re-word some code and try and phrase the same function in different ways, but to no avail. I knew at that point that my equation was off. Eventually I understood that the first month would not receive interest, so I correctly adjusted from that error. SNHU's online tutoring assistance has really helped me this term.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I feel more confident with more number problems and equations, so that can pretty much be translated to any line of work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried my best to stick to industry standards on C++ formatting and best practices. That kept things from going off the rails and overwhelming me too much.
